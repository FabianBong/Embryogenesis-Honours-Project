# Embryogenesis-Honours-Project

This project is focused on the analysis of embryogenesis data to detect modulations of DNA methylation across different developmental stages. 
Any analysis has been performed with R. The workflows are referring to any processing outside of R in a shell-environment (mostly on SIKU provided by Compute Canada).
